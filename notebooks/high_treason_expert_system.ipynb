    "At first glance there may be some advantage to having the get_actions() functions return True/False, rather than a list. After all, if any one condition is met, the defendant committed high treason. But this overlooks the fact that a defendant may have committed the same offence through different means. A person who levies war against Canada AND assists a separate armed force hostily engaged with Canadian Forces commits high treason twice. Similarly, a person may have caused the sovereign bodily harm that amounts to both maiming and bodily harm tending to cause death, and can be fairly charged and tried for both offences (albeit not convicted of both, per *Stinchcombe*.) A list allows the program to record multiple offence instances using fewer passes. Lists save time and ensure the program remains extensible."
