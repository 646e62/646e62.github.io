    "The offence dictionary's primary purpose is to store an offence's elements. \n",

    "* Date/time\n",
    "* Jurisdiction\n",
    "* Identity\n",
    "* Liability type\n",
    "* Statutory authority\n",

    "Other offence elements will only be present in certain offences, and may not all be required to be present to make out the offence. Where that is the case, it is often also the case that more than one of these offence elements will mean that more than one instance of the offence exists. High treason, for example, includes several elements that aren't present in other Canadian criminal offence, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Doing bodily harm that tends to cause death or destruction\n",
    "* Restraining the sovereign\n",
    "* Imprisoning the sovereign\n",
    "* Assisting an enemy at war with Canada\n",
    "\n",
    "Any one of these elements is enough to make out high treason. If more than one is present, it may be the case that more than one offence has been committed, provided there are separate transactions. I can start implementing code to identify, distinguish, and handle these separate transactions once the expert system is more completely laid out. Until then, it will suffice to say that each ```Offence``` instance represents a separate transaction. Where transactions contain multiple offence possibilities, they will be inclusively contained and subject to *Kienapple* if more than one is made out.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to be usefully implemented into a chat model like GPT, these offence elements will need to be broken down into the smallest possible atoms. For example, the offence element \"Did the defendant do bodily harm to the sovereign tending to cause death or destruction?\" can and should be broken down further into the following atomic elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Death\n",
    "    * The defendant caused bodily harm\n",
    "    * The sovereign suffered the bodily harm\n",
    "    * The bodily harm the sovereign suffered tends to cause death\n",

    "    * The defendant caused bodily harm\n",
    "    * The sovereign suffered the bodily harm\n",
    "    * The bodily harm the sovereign suffered tends to cause destruction\n",
    "    \n",
    "Elements can be necessary, sufficient, or both.\n",
    "\n",
    "All offence elements can be expressed as tuples. The first index contains the factual matrix while the second describes the element's relationship to the offence generally. \n",
    "\n",
    "Universal elements should be evaluated separately from existential elements. Because universal elements are always required, they can be evaluated first to see if the facts support the charge past these basics. If so, the existential elements can be considered next.\n",
    "\n",
    "The necessity or sufficiency of the existential elements assumes that the requisite universal elements are made out. That is, an existential element may be necessary and sufficient, but only if all the universal elements are met. If they are not, the existential element will not be sufficient.\n",
