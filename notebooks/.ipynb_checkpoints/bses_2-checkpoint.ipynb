    "The final step is to code a function that will check to determine whether there is jurisdiction for an offence. To do so, the function will need to check both ```Facts``` and ```Defendant``` objects to see whether any of the necessary jurisdictional preconditions have been met. Because this offence has its own form of constructive jurisdiction, the control flow will have to account for that:\n",

If it did, it would print them out. But jurisdiction introduces a new issue, such that we can't say that high treason was committed unless we also establish that the offence occurred *in Canada*. To do this, we need to expand ```verify_high_treason```'s scope. For now, this function is class-independent."
