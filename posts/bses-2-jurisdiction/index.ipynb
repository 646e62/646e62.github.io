Because case law introduces new legal rules, nuances, definitions, and applications, accounting for case law necessarily complicates statutory interpretation control flow. Bypassing these complications for a minimally-viable product is a sensible way to start. But once we have that MVP, we need a system that accounts for legal ambiguities and tells the user when more than one conclusion is possible. Because high treason has limited court consideration, these potential complications will be much fewer than those introduced in frequently-charged offences.\n",
