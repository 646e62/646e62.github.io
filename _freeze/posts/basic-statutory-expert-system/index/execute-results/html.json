I plan to address the rationale behind this assumption in a later post. But for now, I will lay out a simple and intuitively-coded expert system that addresses a specific and basic legal problem.\n\n## Why high treason?\n\nThere are several key advantages to working with an offence like high treason:\n\n* **Minimal statutory elements.** Although high treason \n* **Few conditional layers.**\n* **Sufficient complexity.**\n* **Underlitigated.** Although all Canadian criminal offences begin as codified statutes, most accumulate greater complexity through litigation. Courts ask and answer what certain words mean in certain circumstances and often add dozens of conditions to one or more basic elemental steps.\n\nA straightforward and under-litigated offence like high treason is the perfect start for this project. \n\n# Control flow\n\nConditional sequence\n\nWhen reading up on legal tech's intersections with AI and expert systems, Robert Kowalski, Fariba Sadri, and \nMarek Sogot's paper \"The British \nNationality Act as a Logic Program\" frequently comes up as a black swan event in legal AI.[^bnapaper] \n\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart TD\n    B[Is the defendant guilty of high treason?] --> C{Who is the complainant}\n    C --> D[The Sovereign]\n    C --> F[Neither]\n    C --> E[Canada]\n    F --> G1[Not guilty]\n    E --> H[\"Did the defendant\n    • Levy war against the complainant\n    • Prepare to levy war against the complainant\n    • Assist an enemy at war with the complainant\n    • Assist a hostile armed force engaged with the complainant\"]\n    H -->|Yes| I1[Guilty]\n    H -->|No| G\n    D --> J[\"Did the defendant: \n    • Kill the sovereign\n    • Attempt to kill the soveregin\n    • Inflict bodily harm tending to cause death on the sovereign\n    • Inflict bodily harm tending to cause destruction on the sovereign\n    • Maim the sovereing\n    • Wound the sovereign\n    • Imprison the sovereign\n    • Restrain the sovereign\"]\n    J -->|Yes| I2[Guilty]\n    J -->|No| G2[Not guilty]\n```\n\n_Figure 1_: An ugly flowchart describing the basic expert system's flow control\n\n\n\n# AI disclaimer\n\nI've used the following AI tools to help create this project:\n\n* **Spelling and grammar.** Grammarly (non-generative)\n* **Text summarization.** ChatGPT-3.5 & 4\n* **Code.** ChatGPT-3.5 & 4, GitHub Copilot (GPT-3.5 based)\n* **Legal research.** CanLII (non-generative)\n* **Images.** DALL-E\n\n[^bnapaper]: See e.g. [AI & Law: British Nationality Act Unexpectedly Spurred AI And Law](https://lance-eliot.medium.com/ai-law-british-nationality-act-unexpectedly-spurred-ai-and-law-404aea03386a), [How the British Nationality Act Served to Inadvertently Spur AI and the Law](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3975784).\n\n",
